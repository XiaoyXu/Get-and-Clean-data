Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a introduction for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera.

The R code is for creating a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the raw data.

Download the data from:

Extract it into the data directory under your R working directory.

Eun R code run_analysis.R or source it. It will generate a text file named "TidyData.txt". This is the final result.
